Java Multithreading with semaphores

The purpose of this project was to become more familiar with the creation and
execution of threads, and the use of the Threadâ€™s class methods. In order to 
synchronize the threads I used (when necessary), run( ), start( ), 
currentThread( ), getName( ), join( ), yield( ), sleep(time), isAlive( ), getPriority( ), 
setPriority( ), interrupt( ). A continuation of this project was to use semaphores.
