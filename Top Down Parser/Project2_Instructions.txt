-The input test files should be placed directly in the src project folder.

-A blank output textfile must be saved in the src project folder as well since the output file 
will appear here displaying a list of tokens from the input file source code.

-They may be saved in any format since they will be passed as arguments but order matters since the
input file argument is hardcoded first. Adjust the arguments below respectively, input then output. 

-Go to the Run tab-> Scroll to Run Configurations-> Parser-> Arguments-> Program Arguments
type in input textfile followed by output textfile with a single space in between, no commas are necessary.
The program runs for all inputN.txt that it finds and compares every time the output with outputN.txt,
so multiple inputs and outputs may be saved respectively, e.g. input1.txt output1.txt

-The program directory should also be correct to avoid file not found exceptions, 
I ran it manually through Run Configurations->Arguments->Working Directory->Default or Other
